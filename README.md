# SWOT Analysis Tool

## Overview
The SWOT Analysis Tool is a robust framework for conducting comprehensive Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis, enhanced with cutting-edge technologies. This project integrates advanced data processing, real-time analytics, and AI-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Powered by Kafka and RabbitMQ for reliable and scalable event streaming.
- **AI Engine**: Includes OpenCV, ONNX, and NVIDIA Triton for advanced data analysis and image processing.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes gRPC with Protobuf for low-latency communication and Quiche/HTTP3 for secure data transport.
- **Databases**:
  - Time-Series: InfluxDB.
  - Transactional: Cloudflare D1/PostgreSQL.
  - Immutable Storage: immudb with IPFS for archival.
- **Zero Trust Security**: Enforced via Cloudflare Zero Trust.
- **Quantum-Safe Encryption**: Combines QKD and PQC for future-proof encryption.
- **Performance Optimization**: Cloudflare Workers for edge compute and Redis caching for fast data access.
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS Cluster for distributed archival.
